<p>Uncrumpled is designed to be very simple and very rewarding to use.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">That being said, there are many plans for advanced features.  As you become more</div>
<div class="line">comfortable with the basic features, it&#8217;s very natural to want more control and flexibility</div>

<p><strong>2. Uncrumpled strives to promote and reward cognitive thinking!</strong></p>
<p>The use of uncrumpled is meant to be somewhat like this.</p>
<img alt="_images/methodology.png" class="align-center" src="_images/methodology.png" />
<p><em>Why Uncrumpled</em></p>
<p>Uncrumpled is all about automation. It&#8217;s a fasicantion of the founder Tim.
Conventional note taking programs give you a place to store and retrieve your data.
As your data set grows, you have to remember your orginizational structure and often
struggle to find your information. Thought flows are distrubted and you are required to
invest time into learning your noteaking landacape. If you fall into a lapse of laziness then everything
seems to fall into a mess.</p>
<p>Uncrumped requires learning at the beginning, to understand what, tags, hotkeys, workboos mean and the
configuration options that come with them. The user is then rewarded with a note taking process taht scales up,
becomming easy to maintain and manage the more data you have. These terms may sound familiar but uncrumpled
handles notetaking differently than other software on the market</p>
<p>Uncrumpled also makes it clear that we don&#8217;t want to be in your face. Your notetaking interface is seperate
from your origniazational interface, this is possible because uncrumpled is about defining relationships
between what you are doing and what you are using on your computer, you set hotkeys to your notes that will
dynamically display the note that you require.</p>
<p>The development of uncrumpled is still evolving and right now we are focused on helping users take notes
specifically for learning or improving a skill. New feautres may be present/made avaliable but we are going to
focus our attentio right now to those features that help us acheive the goal of learning. As humans we are
always learning and uncrumpled we are here to give you the edge, so that learning is an enjoyable process,
your notes become an extension of your brain.</p>
<p>This is just an overview designed to peek your interest, toriales find here!.
The variety of tasks and knowdlege avalible on the interent is vast and to deal with all the
possibilites of learning.</p>
<p>Let us take the case of university.
With university level courses its common to recieve task over the internet.</p>
<p>A typical user might group the content by year or semester, and the course.
You would of course then have your different files per week or perhaps as a soup in the folder.</p>
<p>In uncrumpled, we have two organizaitonal tools to us, profiles and books.</p>
<p>Profiles are a group of settings that i want to use. I may like to have different settings for learning, gaming, working etc.
These settings would control what hotekys are avaliable and so on.</p>
<p>In our university example our user start with creating a University profile. All he needs to do is set the name.
Bob wants to start taking notes right away for his math class so he creates a new book and calls it problems.
He decides alt f1 is a good key for his book, he wants a new note page to be created by default for all pdf files.</p>
<p>After hitting save, bob only needs to make sure that he is using the university profile and hitting alt f1 will bring up his notes.
Bob can now start creating</p>
<p>To take</p>
