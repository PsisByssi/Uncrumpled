**Some Text on Why Uncrumpled**

Uncrumpled is all about automation. It's a fascination of the founder Tim.
Conventional note taking programs give you a place to store and retrieve your data. 
But as your data set grows, you have to remember your organizational structure and often
struggle to find your information. Thought flows are disturbed and you are required to
invest time into learning your note taking landscape. If you fall into a lapse of laziness then everything
seems to fall into a mess.

Uncrumpled requires learning at the beginning, to understand, tags, hot keys, workbooks and the 
configuration options that come with them. 
You as a user however are then rewarded with a note taking process that scales up,
becoming easy to maintain and manage the more data you have. 
Be wary fellow internet traveler, you may have heard these jargon terms used on your quest to find a note taking program, but Uncrumpled
handles note taking differently than any other software on the market.

**Out of the way, yet always there, like a best friend**

Uncrumpled also makes it clear that we don't want to be in your face. Your note taking interface is separate
from your organizational interface, this is possible because Uncrumpled is about defining relationships
between what you are doing, and what you are using on your computer.
