The development of Uncrumpled is still evolving and right now we are focused on helping users take notes
specifically for learning or improving a skill. New features may be present/made available but we are going to
focus our attention right now to those features that help us achieve the goal of learning. As humans we are
always learning and Uncrumpled we are here to give you the edge, so that learning is an enjoyable process,
your notes become an extension of your brain.
