First User Guide 
================

Thank you for using Uncrumpled. We hope you have a good experience!

* If you have not already installed the program see the :ref:`installation-guide`. 
* Also a good read is the :ref:`what` and :ref:`why` of uncrumpled. 	
* A useful reference is the :ref:`glossary-of-terms`.  


Setting up Your First Workbook
------------------------------

1. Open the Program by clicking on the Uncrumpled main icon.
2. Click cancel when you are prompted to view online documentation.

Your are now in the relevant section for creating a new work book.
 
Purpose of your first Workbook!
*******************************
Workbooks are a collection of Notes that are accessible via a shortcut key.
This is particularly useful if we have program specific notes.

I recommend all users should create there first work book as one that
holds program related features. e.g.
how to customise the application. Common shortcuts that you have not 
yet mastered etc.

As more features become avaliable in the program i will add a section for
common design patterns for note taking.	

.. note :: At this stage Uncrumpled has no options for changing this
	default behavior of creating a new page per program.
	This doesn't lend itself to taking notes on cooking for instance.
	
	Support for more general style notes will be coming soon. Head
	over to the forums to have your say
	
	
3. In the **Workbook name** field enter: *Program Usage* or similar 


4. For the workbook archetype Select *Note* from the drop down list. 

5. Click in the Shortcut Key field and press a desired shortcut key.

To reset the shortcut key
	* Wait 5 seconds and then press any key.
	* Change focus to another field and click back
	* Enter more than 3 keys

.. attention :: A guide for selecting hotkeys and shortcuts will be publish in the future.
	I recommend using F6 or F7.

6. Hit the save button, you should see a thumbs up in the bottom right if everything
is okay.

.. tip :: Any time you do save or delete something, a confirmation or error messages will be displayed here!



Creating and Testing Your First Pages
-------------------------------------

That's all the setting up we need to do. We can now navigate to a program and press our hotkey.

1. Navigate to any program and press the hotkey that you defined when you set up your workbook.

2. Type something nice for testing :)

3. Close the page by either pressing your hotkey again, or pressing the Esc key

4. Press your hotkey again to view the saved data

Your data should now be displayed. If it isn't, you might have selected another program window.
Make sure the same program is selected as when you created the page!

5. Now Navigate to another program and repeat the process of adding data, closing and reopening

6. Switch back to the first program and load your data.

7. Go back to the second data and load your data.


.. important :: This is the bread and butter of uncrumpled. This behaviour is extremely powerful.
	It is optimised for mastering computer software. Any time you learn something new.
	Write it down in your note, and it will be saved exactly where you need it.
	With the program!
