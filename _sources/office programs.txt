Office Programs
===============

Text editing is a very common action, even if you are not writing a book or a thesis paper, from time to time you may ask your self, how do i format the page with two coloums? How do i print double sided? There are many such times when we may bundle through and come out the other side with a document, thinking the entire time that there must have been a better way. Maybe next time you will spend the time to do it properly. Or perhaps even a computer course may be necessary.

The devil is in the details and that is deffinitley true with office programs. You may only touch them once every few months, but that feeling that comes with mastering and having complete control over something is always nice to have.

Just slap ppen that uncurmpled note taking window, take 5 minutes to figure out how to accomplish that new task, write it down. And have it ready to go. 1 day, 2 weeks, or 3 years from now when you come back and wonder, how did i do that.

No longer will you wonder my friend because, now you have Uncrumpled!
